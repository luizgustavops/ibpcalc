The invasive blood pressure (ibp) numerics calculation algorithm

This exercise is about finding the closest systolic and diastolic pressures
from a given reference point in the invasive blood pressure waveform.
The algorithm receives a buffer representing the ibp waveform, the
buffer size, and the reference point index selected by the user.

Based on the given filtered invasive blood pressure waveform buffer,
the algorithm tries to find, from the index informed by the user,
the peaks and valleys to determine what are the nearest ibp systolic and
diastolic values at that point.

The search was limited to 6 seconds of waveform, so this algorithm has
a cost of O(1), instead of depending on the size of the input buffer.
This choice is suitable for this kind of problem and defines the 10bpm
as the low heart rate limit for this algorithm to work properly. This
number of bpm is lower than a human heart can work and was took from
the lowest value a well known patient simulator can work (from Fluke
Coporation).

Based on the morphology of the ibp waveform, the algorithm searches for
two peaks and two valleys over the cardiac cycles, representing the systolic
peak, the diastolic valley, the notch peak and the notch valley. The search
is done forward and backward of the informed index, limited to 350 samples
each side (3 seconds), 2 peaks and 2 valleys.

After the search is done forward and backward the index informed by the user,
the algorithm calculates which ones are the closest to the index, as required
by the specification. If the algorithm finds, for example, a higher peak
forward but a closer peak backward, it will return the closer one as the
systolic value. The same rule applies for the diastolic value.

The algorithm return SUCCESS if it finds the systolic and diastolic values
and FAIL otherwise.
