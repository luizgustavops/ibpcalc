IbpCalc library coding style

This is the coding style for the IbpCalc library.

1) Indentation
   Use 3 characters for indentation and no tabs.
   Don't put multiple assignments in a single line.


2) Braces and spaces
   Put the opening brace last on the line and put the closing brace first.
   Use this for all non-function statement blocks. E.g.:

   if (something) {
      ...
   }

   switch(variable) {
   case 'a':
      b;
   case 'c':
      d;
   default:
      break;
   }

   For functions, put the opening brace in the first position of the next line:

   int function(var a, var b, ...)
   {
      ...
      return x;
   }


3) Naming
   Use short variable and function names, with the words in mixed-case letters.
   E.g.:

   int sysIndex;

   int ibpCalc(var a, var b, ...);


4) Commenting
   Use doxygen-style comments. E.g.:

   /**
    * \brief Brief description
    */

   For non-doc comments, use the '//' characters to explain some behaviour of
   the algorithm. E.g.:

   // Temporary variable to store the peak value
   int peakValue;
